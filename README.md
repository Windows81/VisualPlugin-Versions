# VisualPlugin Versions
All 144 versions of [VisualPlugin](https://www.roblox.com/library/741785194/VisualPlugin-useful-building-plugin) that were uploaded to Rōblox ... as `.rbxm` files.

**PS:** the C# code I place there was only meant to copy the files from the <kbd>Unlabelled</kbd> to <kbd>Labelled</kbd>.  In order to be able to open these files, you need *Rōblox Studio*.
